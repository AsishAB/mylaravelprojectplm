A starter Laravel Project that I developed to enhance my skills on PHP, Laravel 8 and MySQL.

Since I started learning above skills, I thought that it would be best to apply my knowledge in building a dummy or personal project, rather than wait for professional ones.

Also, since my skills mostly include backend, I copied some free templates from the internet.

Special Thanks to:-

Colorib

Start BootStrap

Font Awesome Icons

Flaticon

Free Logo Design

Free Front End

Stripo

whose services are used in my project.

Over the time, I will do more such projects as I learn new skills. Very soon, I will start with a similar project using Python and PGSQL.
